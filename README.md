This project focuses on analyzing and predicting cryptocurrency prices, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum, using machine learning techniques. By exploring historical price data, we aim to uncover insights that can help investors make informed decisions.

## Project Goals
1. Analyze historical price data to understand trends and patterns.
2. Visualize price movements using advanced techniques such as candlestick charts.
3. Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict future prices.
4. Provide actionable insights for cryptocurrency trading strategies.

## Outline
1. **Materials and Methods**
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - i) Correlation Analysis
   - ii) Visualizations (Price Trends, Volume Analysis)
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
5. **Key Analysis Questions**

## Materials and Methods
The dataset used in this project includes historical price data for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be obtained from various cryptocurrency exchanges or financial data providers. The specific dataset used for this analysis can be found at [Kaggle: Cryptocurrency Bitcoin and Ethereum Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zsinghrahulk/crypto-currency-bitcoin-and-ethereum-data). The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithms for price prediction.

## Key Analysis Questions
- What are the historical trends in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices?
- How do trading volumes correlate with price movements?
- What features are most significant in predicting future prices?
- Which machine learning model performs best for price prediction?

Additionally, we will conduct visual analyses to enhance the understanding of market behavior and price trends.

## Libraries Used
1. **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
2. **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation.
3. **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
4. **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
5. **TensorFlow**: For building and training machine learning models.
6. **mplfinance**: For creating candlestick charts.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arshmankhalid88/Crypto-Analysis-And-Market-Prediction-.git
   cd Crypto-Analysis-And-Market-Prediction-
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the libraries individually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow mplfinance
   ```

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into cryptocurrency price movements and predictions, enabling investors to implement effective trading strategies and improve their decision-making processes.
